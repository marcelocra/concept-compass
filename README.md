## üèÜ Hackathon Submission Portal

> This project is an evolving entry for two sequential hackathons. I plan to continue developing it long after the competitions are over. To ensure **fair judging**, each submission is preserved in a permanent Git hash and has its own immutable deployment link.

### **üöÄ Current Submission: Kiro.dev Hackathon (Sept 12-15)**

This is the active version of the project, featuring user authentication, session persistence, and a development workflow powered by Kiro.dev.

-   **[üì¶ Code at Submission]()**: TBD
-   **[‚û°Ô∏è Live Demo at Submission]()**: TBD
-   **[üìÑ View on Devpost]()**: TBD

### **üìç Past Milestone: OpenAI `gpt-oss` Hackathon (Sept 9-11)**

The initial MVP was a stateless, client-side focused application built in a 48-hour sprint to demonstrate the core mind-mapping experience with `gpt-oss` models.

-   **[üì¶ Code at Submission](https://github.com/marcelocra/concept-compass/tree/edd2fe74ad9df895b391e674a80f35597a45bb44)**
-   **[‚û°Ô∏è Live Demo at Submission](https://concept-compass-i2oqfkahs-marcelo-almeidas-projects.vercel.app)**
-   **[üìÑ View on Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/concept-compass)**

> [!NOTE]\
> **A Note for Judging**: The Code at Submission link points to the final commit made before the deadline. This version includes several last-minute UI/UX enhancements. These final commits passed all local builds but were prevented from deploying by automated CI checks. Therefore, the Live Demo link reflects the last successful deployment from a few hours prior. For the most complete review of the work accomplished, please refer to the **Code at Submission** link.

## ‚ú® What It Does

Concept Compass is an interactive web application that transforms any keyword or idea into a dynamic, explorable mind map. Instead of a static list of suggestions, it provides a visual graph of interconnected concepts, allowing you to navigate and expand your ideas in any direction, infinitely.

1.  **Plant a Seed:** Start with a single concept (e.g., "The Future of AI Assistants").
2.  **Grow the Universe:** Powered by OpenAI's `gpt-oss` models, it generates a rich mind map of related ideas.
3.  **Explore Infinitely:** Click any node to make it the new center of the universe, revealing ever-deeper layers of thought in a seamless partnership between human curiosity and AI.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

Concept Compass is built with a modern, high-performance tech stack. The entire development process for new features is orchestrated using a **spec-driven workflow** within the **Kiro.dev IDE**.

## üõ£Ô∏è What's Next for Concept Compass

This project is more than a hackathon entry; it's the foundation for a comprehensive creative suite. The roadmap includes:

-   **Branching History & Exploration Trees:** Implement a system to go back and forth in the graph of ideas, allowing a user to explore multiple creative paths from a single starting point.
-   **"Deep Dive" Elaboration Engine:** Add a feature to expand the content of any node, generating a detailed summary or explanation of that specific concept.
-   **Actionable Content Generation:** Create a feature where a user can select a path of nodes and have the AI generate practical content from it, such as a blog post outline or a series of social media posts.
