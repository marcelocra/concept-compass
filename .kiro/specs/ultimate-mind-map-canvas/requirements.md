# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Ultimate Mind Map Canvas is a comprehensive implementation that combines the best visual effects, performance optimizations, and user experience features from multiple canvas iterations. This feature will deliver a visually stunning, high-performance mind mapping interface with intelligent quality management, quantum particle effects, divine node styling, and smooth navigation capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a visually stunning mind map canvas with quantum particle effects and divine styling, so that I can have an immersive and inspiring brainstorming experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the canvas loads THEN the system SHALL display a quantum particle field background with mouse interaction gravity effects
2. WHEN the user hovers over the canvas THEN particles SHALL be attracted to the mouse cursor with realistic physics
3. WHEN the central node is displayed THEN it SHALL feature divine container structure with ethereal aurora field, shimmer effects, orbital rings, sacred geometry, and holographic elements
4. WHEN related nodes are displayed THEN they SHALL feature crystalline containers with prismatic effects, hover glow, glass morphism, floating sparkles, and diamond lattice patterns
5. WHEN edges connect nodes THEN they SHALL display plasma flow effects with quantum particles, trails, gradient animations, and energy pulses at connection points

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the canvas to automatically adjust visual quality based on my device's performance, so that I can have smooth interactions regardless of my hardware capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the canvas initializes THEN the system SHALL detect device capabilities and set appropriate quality mode (Ultra, High, Medium, Performance)
2. WHEN the frame rate drops below 30 FPS THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce quality mode to maintain smooth performance
3. WHEN the frame rate is consistently above 50 FPS THEN the system SHALL gradually increase quality mode if not at maximum
4. WHEN in Performance mode THEN the system SHALL use CSS particle fallback instead of canvas-based particles
5. WHEN quality mode changes THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition between visual states without jarring changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth navigation with breadcrumbs and history management, so that I can easily explore the mind map and return to previous states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on a node THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition it to the center position with proper animation timing
2. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL update breadcrumb navigation with ellipsis handling for long concept names
3. WHEN I hover over breadcrumb items THEN the system SHALL display tooltips with full concept names
4. WHEN I navigate through the mind map THEN the system SHALL maintain history without polluting browser navigation
5. WHEN I use keyboard shortcuts THEN the system SHALL respond with the same smooth transitions as mouse interactions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the mind map layout to follow sacred geometry and golden ratio principles, so that the visual arrangement feels naturally harmonious and aesthetically pleasing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN nodes are positioned THEN the system SHALL use golden angle spiral combined with sacred geometry principles
2. WHEN calculating node positions THEN the system SHALL apply golden ratio (1.618) for spacing and proportions
3. WHEN displaying multiple levels THEN the system SHALL implement elliptical depth with vertical spread variation
4. WHEN the layout updates THEN the system SHALL maintain geometric harmony while accommodating different numbers of related concepts
5. WHEN nodes are added or removed THEN the system SHALL smoothly animate to new positions following the geometric constraints

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive performance monitoring and optimization, so that I can understand system performance and have the best possible experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the canvas is active THEN the system SHALL monitor FPS and provide performance metrics
2. WHEN expensive operations are triggered THEN the system SHALL use debouncing to prevent performance degradation
3. WHEN animations are running THEN the system SHALL use requestAnimationFrame for canvas animations and CSS transforms for DOM animations
4. WHEN components render THEN the system SHALL use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback appropriately to prevent unnecessary re-renders
5. WHEN heavy effects are enabled THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading and GPU acceleration where possible

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want touch gesture support and responsive controls, so that I can use the mind map effectively on mobile devices and tablets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using touch devices THEN the system SHALL support pinch-to-zoom gestures
2. WHEN using touch devices THEN the system SHALL support pan gestures for canvas navigation
3. WHEN using touch devices THEN the system SHALL support tap gestures for node selection and navigation
4. WHEN touch interactions occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback
5. WHEN switching between touch and mouse input THEN the system SHALL adapt the interface appropriately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth loading states and error recovery, so that I have a polished experience even when things go wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the canvas is loading THEN the system SHALL display quantum loading animation with sacred geometry
2. WHEN loading progress can be determined THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement graceful error recovery without breaking the interface
4. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
5. WHEN the system recovers from errors THEN the system SHALL restore the previous state smoothly
