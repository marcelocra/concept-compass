# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Concept Compass MVP is an AI-powered interactive mind mapping application that transforms any keyword or idea into a dynamic, explorable graph. The core functionality allows users to enter a concept, generate related ideas using AI, and infinitely explore by clicking on any node to make it the new center of exploration. This MVP focuses on the essential brainstorming experience without persistence features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to enter an initial concept on the main page, so that I can start my brainstorming session with a single seed idea.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the main page THEN the system SHALL display a single text input field prominently on the page
2. WHEN the user types in the text input THEN the system SHALL accept any text string as a valid concept
3. WHEN the user submits the concept (via Enter key or submit button) THEN the system SHALL initiate the mind map generation process
4. IF the input is empty THEN the system SHALL prevent submission and display a validation message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my concept and related ideas displayed as an interactive mind map, so that I can visually explore the connections between concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user submits a concept THEN the system SHALL display a React Flow canvas with the initial concept as the central node
2. WHEN the mind map is generated THEN the system SHALL display 5-8 related concepts as connected nodes around the central concept
3. WHEN the mind map is displayed THEN the system SHALL show clear visual connections (edges) between the central node and related nodes
4. WHEN the user interacts with the canvas THEN the system SHALL support zooming, panning, and node selection
5. IF the API call fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a backend API endpoint that generates related concepts, so that the frontend can request AI-generated ideas for any given concept.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/api/generate` with a concept THEN the system SHALL accept the request with a JSON payload containing the concept
2. WHEN the API receives a valid concept THEN the system SHALL call the OpenAI API to generate 5-8 related concepts
3. WHEN the OpenAI API responds successfully THEN the system SHALL return a JSON response with the generated concepts
4. WHEN the OpenAI API call fails THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response with status code 500
5. IF the concept parameter is missing or empty THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with validation message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click on any node in the mind map to make it the new center, so that I can explore deeper into specific areas of interest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on any node (except the current center) THEN the system SHALL make that node the new central concept
2. WHEN a node becomes the new center THEN the system SHALL call the `/api/generate` endpoint with the new concept
3. WHEN new related concepts are generated THEN the system SHALL update the mind map to show the new center with its related concepts
4. WHEN the mind map updates THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth visual transitions and preserve the canvas state
5. WHEN generating new concepts THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator to provide user feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the mind map to have an intuitive and clean interface, so that I can focus on my ideas without distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mind map is displayed THEN the system SHALL use a clean, minimalist design consistent with the application's visual identity
2. WHEN nodes are rendered THEN the system SHALL display concept text clearly with appropriate font sizes and colors
3. WHEN the user hovers over a clickable node THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback (hover effects)
4. WHEN the mind map is loading THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading states
5. WHEN the application is viewed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain usability and readability

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I can understand what went wrong and continue using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API call fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN the OpenAI API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL inform the user that the service is temporarily unavailable
3. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback and retry options
4. WHEN an unexpected error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error details for debugging while showing a generic error message to the user
5. IF the user encounters an error THEN the system SHALL allow them to retry the operation or start over with a new concept
